# analysis_options.yaml 
# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# Activating Flutter's recommended lints to enforce good coding practices
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable or enable specific rules.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a rule project-wide, you can suppress it in specific
  # places using `// ignore: rule_name` or `// ignore_for_file: rule_name`.
  rules:
    # Uncomment to customize linting rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Allows using `print` statements
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Enforces single quotes instead of double
